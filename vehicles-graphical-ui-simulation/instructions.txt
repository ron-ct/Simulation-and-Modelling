Your work: Simulate Graphically
1. Draw these vehicles. Make sure they look good. Color these cars
2. You have to use a random function to draw.
3. The length(size) of the cars should vary. ie when you run the code again, the length should be bigger ir smaller.

5. use a draw() method polygons etc.
6. Wheels should always be at the right place.
7. The color must vary also - Color of the cars should change.

11. You may use flower maker tools from the internet.
12. The flowers must have petals and stems.
13. The flowers should have varying/different colors or the color of the flowers should change each time you run the code.
14. There is to be a color fit function in the flower generator that should have a random function so that the color can change.
