Create a Console App


Roll a die 1000 times.
Use a generator that  generates random numbers between 0 and 1.
Give your answers in the table:

Face        |Frequency      |Percentage

Frequency - int, should add up to 1000.
Percentage column - 1 d.p
Whenever we rerun the script, we should get different output (random).


0 < x < 1/6         1st Face     
1/6 < x < 2/6       2nd Face
2/6 < x < 3/6        3rd Face
3/6 < x < 4/6        4th Face
4/6 < x < 5/6       5th Face
5/6 < x < 6/6        6th Face
